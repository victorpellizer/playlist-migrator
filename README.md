Just for fun (and because I really need it)

To use:
1 - create your virtual environment "python -m venv .venv"
2 - install environment packages "pip install -r requirements.txt"

4 - on main.py fill the your_source_spotify_playlist variable with the url from the Spotify playlist that you want to grab songs from
5 - on main.py fill the your_destination_ytm_playlist variable with the url from the YoutubeMusic playlist that you want to store your songs at
